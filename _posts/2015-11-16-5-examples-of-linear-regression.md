_Push these sexy applications in his mind to spice things up and drive him nuts_

Everyone knows that linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables denoted X. But as you more vigorously apply these concepts and analyses to your everyday life, how do you keep up your own relationship with your man?

Studies show that whispering specific different applications of linear regression models will keep him begging for more. So keep your man fired up with these sexy tidbits.

## Trend Lines

A trend line represents the long-term movement in time series data after other components have been accounted for. It tells whether a particular data set (say GDP, oil prices or stock prices) have increased or decreased over the period of time. A trend line could simply be drawn by eye through a set of data points, but more properly their position and slope is calculated using statistical techniques, like, you guessed it. linear regression. Just try to keep him off of you after telling him this.

## Epidemiology

Early evidence relating smoking to mortality and morbidity came from observational studies employing regression analysis. In order to reduce spurious correlations when analyzing observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models in addition to the variable of primary interest. For example, suppose we have a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of interest, and the dependent variable is lifespan measured in years. Researchers might include socio-economic status as an additional independent variable, to ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to some effect of education or income. However, it is never possible to include all possible confounding variables in an empirical analysis. 
**Hint:** Really emphasize how impossible these confounding variables are. He'll never want to let you go!

## Finance

The capital asset pricing model:

...uses linear regression as well as the concept of beta for analyzing and quantifying the systematic risk of an investment. This comes directly from the beta coefficient of the linear regression model that relates the return on the investment to the return on all risky assets. The point is to be playful and work him into a desire-filled frenzy by not giving him exactly what he wants (a lower measure of the risk arising from exposure to general market movements as opposed to idiosyncratic factors)!


## Econometrics

Linear regression is the predominant empirical tool in economics. In modern econometrics, other statistical tools are frequently used, but linear regression is still the most frequently used starting point for an analysis. Estimating a linear regression on two variables can be visualized as fitting a line through data points representing paired values of the independent and dependent variables. Mention Okun's Law here and he'll be wondering, "wow, how'd she do that?"


## Environmental Science

Linear regression finds application in a wide range of environmental science applications. In Canada, the Environmental Effects Monitoring Program uses statistical analyses on fish and benthic surveys to measure the effects of pulp mill or metal mine effluent on the aquatic ecosystem. After you tell him this, he'll crave you so much that he won't know what he did to deserve you.

Driving your boyfriend crazy with linear regression application examples is a guaranteed way to make your relationship more fun, dynamic, and sexy. If you want to drive your man wild and to make him want you even more, you have to be bold, adventurous, and sexy, and to remember to keep things feeling exciting and fresh by telling him all the exotic ways that these applications can be applied.

Go get 'em, sister.
