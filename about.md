Hi there! I'm Cassidy Williams, a computer science senior at Iowa State University, graduating in less than a month!

I have work experience from various companies, including Intuit, Microsoft, and General Mills. Upon graduation, I'll be working for [Venmo](http://venmo.com) in New York City!

When I'm not studying or playing with programming languages, I fool around with Photoshop, blog for CycloneLife.com, watch movies, root for the Cyclones, play guitar, eat a lot, practice Spanish (I studied abroad my sophomore year to Spain), and salsa dance. 

I also enjoy public speaking, and I have done so at events like the National Center for Women & IT Summit, the U.S. Department of Labor's Diversity in Tech event, and the IINSPIRE (Iowa-Illinois-Nebraska STEM Partnership for Innovation in Research and Education) conference, TEDxDesMoines, and even at the United Nations this past year. 

You can look at my works on my website, [cassidoo.co](http://cassidoo.co) or on my [Github profile](http://github.com/cassidoo).  I try to code a little everyday, so be sure to keep checking it out!

It brings joy to my heart that you've read this far, so here is a joke for you: How do you organize a space party? You planet.
