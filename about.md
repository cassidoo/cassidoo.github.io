Hi!  I'm Cassidy, and I'm a software engineer and developer evangelist at Clarifai, located in NYC.

I love front-end dev, but dabble in back-end sometimes, too.

I enjoy public speaking and has done so at events like the Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing, the National Center for Women & IT Summit, the U.S. Department of Labor's Diversity in Tech event, TEDxDesMoines, the United Nations, and the U.S. Science and Engineering Festival.

I interned throughout my four years at Iowa State University at a few companies, including Intuit, Microsoft, and General Mills.

When I'm not working, I fool around with Photoshop, watch movies, play guitar, eat a lot, practice Spanish, and salsa dance.

You should check out my website, [cassidoo.co](http://cassidoo.co) or my [Github profile](http://github.com/cassidoo).  Or don't.  I'm not your mother.

It brings joy to my heart that you've read this far, so here is a joke for you: How do you organize a space party? You planet.
